[roʊ]</question>
  <answer>【考法】 n.争吵，争执：an often noisy or angry expression of differing opinions<br />
【例】The incipient row regarding taxes could affect trade between the two countries much more than the festering dispute over banana imports, which has been going on for years. Unfortunately, the trade regulators seem to be ignoring both disagreements.关于税收的初期争端会比持续多年的香蕉进口纠纷对两国贸易影响更大，但不幸的是这两起争执都被贸易监督机构忽略了。<br />
【近】altercation, controversy, disagreement, dispute, dissension, fight, imbroglio, quarrel, squabble, wrangle<br />
【反】 accord, assent, agreement, consensus, harmony, unanimity, unison  一致同意</answer>
